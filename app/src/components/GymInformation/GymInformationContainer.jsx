                <p>
                    My name is Keith Kubiesa,I have a personal training background and in 2012 obtained my CSCS (Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist) 
                    from the NSCA (National Strength & Conditioning Association). I was a NCAA golfer, pro-am snowboarder, and enthusiastic highly motivated rock climber. 
                    My life journey has been spent performing athletically at a high level and most recently helping others do the same through my experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently the Head Coach for the University of Wisconsin-Madison Climbing team and Strength coach for team PBC racing (triathlon team). 
                    Other organizations I work with include; The MWC (Madison Womens Climbers), Edgewood Golf, UW Hoofers, Apex Adventure Alliance, 
                    and the Tyrol Basin Snowboard Team. I have had clients qualify and compete at USA climbing Nationals, USA snowboarding Nationals as well as 
                    members of the high school state golf champion team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work with clients to clarify goals, visualize them and build a road map toward achieving them. Strength training, mental awareness, 
                    recovery methods and nutrition are some of the tools and techniques I provide to help you get there.
